# pathos 0.0.1

* added function  `find_paths` motivated by Mark Padgham with package 'osmdata' needing
 to detect and "remove" internal boundaries between parts within a multipolygon
 (invalid as per simple features)
 
* first creation, inspired from work on Argos tracking of penguins by Nina Deinhard 
 for matching with Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) forecast winds
